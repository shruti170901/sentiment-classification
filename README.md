# Sentiment Classification

## Task Definition: 
Sentiment analysis is the task of classifying the polarity of a given text.
For instance, a text-based tweet can be categorized as either "positive," "negative," or
"neutral". Given the text and accompanying labels, a model can be trained to predict the
correct sentiment. Sentiment analysis techniques can be categorized into machine
learning, lexicon-based, and even hybrid methods. Some subcategories of research in
sentiment analysis include multimodal sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment
analysis, fine-grained opinion analysis, and language-specific sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

1. Implement a sentiment analysis using the single layer Bi-LSTM model. You are
free to decide the hidden dimension and all other hyper-parameters in the
network. Also choose proper error function for this task.

2. You can use FastText/Glove/word2vec and pre-trained embedding to initialize
the model.

## Evaluation Metrics: 
F1 score (For evaluating all the models)
